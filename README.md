## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations using Python and SpaCy (and optionally NLTK).  
It includes:
1. Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and POS filtering.  
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) and pronoun ambiguity detection.

## 🧠 Task Details

### **Q1: Text Preprocessing**
Steps performed:
- Tokenize the input sentence  
- Remove stopwords  
- Apply **lemmatization** (not stemming)  
- Keep only **nouns and verbs** based on POS tags  

**Input Example:**
"John enjoys playing football while Mary loves reading books in the library."



**Expected Output:**
['enjoy', 'play', 'football', 'love', 'read', 'book', 'library']



---

### **Q2: Named Entity Recognition + Pronoun Ambiguity**
- Performs **NER** using SpaCy.  
- Checks for pronouns (“he”, “she”, “they”) to detect ambiguity.

**Input Example:**
"Chris met Alex at Apple headquarters in California. He told him about the new iPhone launch."



**Expected Output:**
Named Entities:
Chris → PERSON
Alex → PERSON
Apple → ORG
California → GPE
iPhone → PRODUCT

Warning: Possible pronoun ambiguity detected!

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

### **1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Python 3.11 Recommended)**
```bash
py -3.11 -m venv spacyenv
spacyenv\Scripts\activate
2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
💡 If SpaCy fails on your system, you can use the NLTK fallback code included.

🚀 How to Run
Save the following scripts in your project directory:

Q1_preprocessing.py

Q2_ner_ambiguity.py

Then execute:


python Q1_preprocessing.py
python Q2_ner_ambiguity.py
🧩 Dependencies
Python 3.11

SpaCy 3.8+

en_core_web_sm language model

(Optional) NLTK for fallback processing

📄 Output
Both scripts print results to the console.
